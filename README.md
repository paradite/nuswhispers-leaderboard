NUSWhispers Leaderboard
==

1. Add a valid Facebook access token to `download-whispers.py`.
2. Run the script to download the latest version of posts from NUSWhispers Facebook page.

## Future Extensions
- Weekly leaderboard instead of monthly.
- Show top comments contents too (Will need to modify the fields in `download-whispers.py` to include message content).
- Will be integrated into NUSWhispers in the near future (hopefully).
